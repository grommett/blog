# Hi, I'm David
## Who I Am
I'm the UI lead for the Operations Dashboard at IBM. In some places at IBM I'm even identified as a UX lead. I'm not a huge fan of that title TBH. In reality, I'm a programmer with an art degree and I like programming much more than designing. I do love art, though and programming is definitely art.

I'd say a better description is that I'm a developer with an eye for design and motion that loves to solve difficult problems. I have over a decade of team lead experience and two decades of programming experience. In addition to being a coder, I've been a business owner, technical lead, and technical liaison for brands like UPS, Chase, and Marriott Hotels. Prior to my current role at IBM I lived in Berlin, Germany and worked at [Zalando](https://en.zalando.de/?_rfl=de).

## What I Do
These days I work with an amazing team making the VPC Operation's Dashboard one of IBM's most successful internal tools. What is this thing that I'm bragging about? I'll paste in our pitch:

>The VPC Operation's Dashboard is the interface between IBM Cloud resources and internal users. Our users include SREs, IPOPS and others gathering information about inventory and metrics. This dashboard's primary use case is to help users quickly find information about IBM Cloud resources to understand customer issues, determine possible causes, and identify actions needed to fix them.

It's by luck that I landed on the Ops Dashboard and it's success is due to the hard work and great thinking that happened well before I arrived.

## Why I'm Here
In the blog posts that follow I hope to bring new perspectives (maybe not new ideas) on code, team leadership and anything else that comes to mind worth sharing.

Thanks for getting this far!
